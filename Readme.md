## Introduction

This repository contains the files that has been created as result for the "Machine Learning" assignment.

In this assignment we have to explore a dataset that contains informations about training activities that has been registered using devices that can calculate acceleartion, position, etc.

After the data exploration, we need to analyze the data with some prediction models and compare their accuracy.
With the best method found we will try to predict the activity that has been done against a separate dataset on which we dont have informations and submit the results.


## Data source

The data has been taken from <http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har>.
